      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a project and product manager transitioning into software engineering.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in Oakland, went to UCSB for a music degree, and am back in the Bay Area.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Making music, playing video games, spending time with my pets, mountain biking, hiking, camping, music festivals</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Retired early</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Florence, Italy</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I love learning and problem solving, and found working in proximity to software engineers to be very interesting and exciting. I loved getting involved in the design-level problem solving (don't worry, I wasn't telling devs how to do their job as a PM) and figuring out how to best meet user needs and product requirements.</p>
